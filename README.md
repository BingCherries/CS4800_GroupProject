# CS4800_GroupProject - Snack-Overflow
This is a web service project for pet owners to track and manage their pets' food allergies.

## Problem Statement
  Pet owners often struggle to identify which ingredients in their pets’ food are causing allergies, leading to discomfort and health issues for their pets.

  These challenges occur due to a couple of factors:
* Pet food labels and long lists of ingredients make it difficult to pinpoint what’s causing the allergic reaction.
* Pets may react differently to the same ingredient in different formulas.

## Solution
  Build a web service that helps users track and manage their pets’ allergies.

* **User**: Log ingredients and record allergic reactions for each food item.
* **Service**: Analyzes user data to identify patterns and common allergens. The service then provides real-time alerts when users input new food items, highlighting potential allergens based on past experiences.

## Features
* **Log Ingredients**: Input and save the ingredients of all food and snacks given to your pet.
* **Record Allergic Reactions**: Detailed records of allergic reactions, including symptoms and severity, for each food item.
* **Identify Common Allergens**: Automatically analyze the logged data to identify common ingredients causing allergic reactions.
* **Real-Time Alerts**: Receive instant alerts when adding new food items, highlighting potential allergens based on past reactions.
* **Generate Allergy Reports**: Create detailed reports summarizing your pet's allergy history, including identified allergens and reaction patterns.
* **User Dashboard**: Organized overview of logged ingredients, recorded reactions, identified allergens, and generated reports.
